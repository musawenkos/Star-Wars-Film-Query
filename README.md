The Search bar should be implemented such that, a user can search for Films (https://swapi.dev/api/films/?search={param}). The user should be able to click on a Film. When a Film is clicked on, a page outlining the Film's details should be displayed, in a thoughtful (styled) manner. You need not display planets, starships, vehicles and species or characters.
